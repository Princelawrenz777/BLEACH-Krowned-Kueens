    tags: "Krowned Kueens (KK) is a prospective music production software that hinges on the use of generative Artificial Intelligence--and eventually--embodied intelligent agents, where AI meets the physical world. The AI in question will be used to produce sounds from existing audio as well as new, original audio. The primary line-up features a nine-member all-female band who were originally designed by Noriaki Kubo and are owned by VIZ Media.",
