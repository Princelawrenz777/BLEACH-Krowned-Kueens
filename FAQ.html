    <h3 class="faq-title">What is this project about?</h3>
    <p class="faq-text">Krowned Kueens (KK) is a passion project developed by Princelawrenz Hamlin (AKA, me! :]). The idea was conceived back in May 2022, and the project has been in development since September 2023.</p>

    <h3 class="faq-title">How did you discover Bleach?</h3>
    <p class="faq-text">Bleach has had a presence in my life since 2010 via Ichigho's inclusion in "Super Smash Flash" and Bleach airing on Adult Swim (even though I wasn't allowed to watch AS at the time). I became a mega-fan of Bleach in May 2022 when a friend (Ahmir/TheAM150) introduced me to this gacha game known as Bleach: Brave Souls on May 6, 2022. My life has quite literally changed for the better since that very day!</p>

    <h3 class="faq-title">Okay, that's cool and all...but how does it relate to music?</h3>
    <p class="faq-text">Basically, the underlying purpose for this entire project is to get my favorite Anime characters to perform to my favorite songs in real-time. In May 2022, I made a tier list of my favorite Bleach Waifus--and I would listen to different songs as I looked at the tier list. I imagined the characters performing to the songs I was listening to, which I thought would be really cool to see animated or part of some music production software.</p>

    <h3 class="faq-title">What was the project like in its infancy?</h3>
    <p class="faq-text">The earliest rendition of KK involved a 4-member line up featuring: Harribel (Vocals/Rhythym Guitar) + Yoruichi (Drums) + Soifon (Lead Guitar) + Mila Rose (Bass). I was inspired by thrash giants like Metallica, Sepultura, Megadeth, and Slayer for this earliest line up (esepcially Metallica). I had the idea for a storyline as well, but it wouldn't have been as interesting compared to where I've gotten it today. The current 9-member line up is inspired by Slipknot—each member of KK has personality traits that relates to Slipknot's band members through how they're numbered. Interestingly enough, they each relate to Slipknot's early line up without breaking character at all.</p>

    <h3 class="faq-title">What will your audience get out of this project upon completion?</h3>
    <p class="faq-text">The current ideas I have for this project include: A Manga Series, an Animated TV series, and a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). I anticipate the biggest among these 3 will be the DAW—as it will bare the potential to reshape the way music is created, performed, perceived, and enjoyed. The base software will feature eighteen different Anime character Models powered by deep learning audio classification. The software’s programming will allow users to import MP3/WAV files—allowing for the reproduction and modification of existing audio, as well as the creation of original audio (note: original audio can be created without imports). Virtually any form of audio will have the capacity to be replicated and performed in real-time by the character models depending on the genre and instruments used in the chosen file. With a broad selection of characters and instruments, the user is only limited by their own imagination. </p>
